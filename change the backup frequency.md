# Change the Backup Frequency

By default, the backup job for each object type will run every six hours, four times a day. After the backup service has been enabled, you can change the backup frequency. You can customize the backup frequency and schedule each backup service by setting up the backup frequency 1 to 4 times per day and define a start time for the first backup job.

To change the backup frequency, follow the steps below:

1. Click the Settings button in the upper-right corner of the **Exchange Online** , **OneDrive for Business** , **SharePoint Online** , **Office 365 Groups** , **Teams** , **Project Online** , or **Public Folders** section of the **Home** page, and then click **Edit Backup Frequency** from the drop-down list. The **Backup Frequency** pane appears.
2. Select a number from the **How many backup jobs would you like to run per day?** list. AvePoint Cloud Backup service will automatically provide the job schedule according to the frequency you selected.
3. You can change the start time for the first backup job. The rest of the schedules will be automatically calculated and displayed.
4. Click **Apply** when you finish changing the backup frequency and schedule. The changes will take effect from the next backup job. You can also click **Cancel** to return to the **Home** page without saving any changes.
